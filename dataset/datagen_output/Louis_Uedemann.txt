Louis Uedemann (10 January 1854 â€“ 22 November 1912) was an American chess master.
He twice won the U.S. Open Chess Championship at Excelsior 1900 (the first Western Chess Association Championship) and Excelsior 1902 (the 3rd WCA-ch).He developed a code that was later refined by Mr. D. A. Gringmuth, of St. Petersburg,  "a leading Russian problem composer," [Steinitz] and adapted for use with telegraphs for cable matches.  Gringmuth's notation was first used in the telegraphic match between London and St Petersburg in November 1886 (see Chess notation#Uedemann code).
